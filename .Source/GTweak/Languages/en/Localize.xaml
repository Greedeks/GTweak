    <v:String x:Key="tgl1_desc_conf">Windows creates a unique advertising identifier for each user to track your actions. Which is used by application developers and Windows itself for their own purposes, including to offer you specific ads in applications.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl2_desc_conf">Even using a local account, Windows always tries to synchronize your data with Microsoft servers. In particular, the following: themes, passwords, Windows settings, browser settings, language bar settings, simplified access settings, additional settings.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl3_desc_conf">Telemetry (diagnostic data) is data that Windows automatically collects to send to Microsoft servers, or in short, "What? Where?  Why and when do you use it?". Microsoft claims that the data is depersonalized and helps the company develop Windows. Even if you are not concerned about the fact of collecting information, then another problem may arise - excessive load on the processor, which in turn slows down the system.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl4_desc_conf">In the «Task Scheduler» there are services that, after their work, collect data about their work and send it to the Microsoft server.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl5_desc_conf">Microsoft collects data about your software. This information is used by Microsoft to diagnose compatibility issues, but you will not help Microsoft improve compatibility in new versions of Windows because this information is used only for selfish purposes for Microsoft. Disabling this feature prevents potentially sensitive information from being sent.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl6_desc_conf">The tweak will disable the application usage monitoring function, eliminating the collection of data on usage frequency, work duration, and other productivity metrics. As a result, the system will stop analyzing your work process, ensuring the protection of your confidential information.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl7_desc_conf">This tweak disables the data collection mechanism that Microsoft uses to improve its handwriting recognition technology. Regardless of whether you use this feature or not, the system was tracking your activity to enhance recognition accuracy. The changes implemented prevent such data collection, helping to preserve privacy.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl8_desc_conf">The Software Quality Improvement Program (CEIP) is a separate feature that collects information about the configuration of your hardware and how you use the software and services. The program also periodically downloads a file to collect information about problems that you may have with Windows. The program is voluntary and you do not have to send your data to Microsoft, violating your privacy.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl9_desc_conf">This tweak modifies the hosts file by adding the address 0.0.0.0 before specific domain names, effectively blocking them. Additionally, it adjusts the Windows firewall settings to block connections to several IP addresses associated with Microsoft's data collection services.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl10_desc_conf">Disabling geolocation services significantly reduces the potential for using location data for advertising purposes – access to this information is restricted not only for Microsoft services but also for any third-party applications and scripts.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl11_desc_conf">The tweak blocks the collection of feedback and its notifications in Windows, which prevents data from being transmitted without your consent. Meanwhile, even if you do not use the «Feedback» feature, Microsoft still logs how frequently you contact official support.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl12_desc_conf">Windows is capable of recognizing speech using a dedicated speech recognition and synthesis module. Even if you do not use Cortana or «Ease of Access», your operating system by default always checks for updates to its voice recognition engine.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl13_desc_conf">A function that has access to any user data. It exchanges some information with Microsoft servers and does not affect the operation of the operating system or applications in any way. It does not help the user in any way, which makes it useless.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl14_desc_conf">Microsoft regularly conducts experiments with Windows users to determine whether a feature is widely used, whether changing a feature makes it more useful. But in turn, this is a violation of confidentiality.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl15_desc_conf">The services DiagTrack, dmwappushservice, and diagsvc act as keyloggers — they record every user activity, including keystrokes, and send this data to Microsoft's servers without the user's consent. When using UWF (Unified Write Filter), the stable operation of the system depends on the dmwappushservice service. However, if you do not know what it is or if you have an alternative tool, it makes sense to get rid of these keyloggers.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl16_desc_conf">An event log that collects and processes system diagnostic information, wasting your computer's resources. The service will not give you anything good, it is better to disable it, so you will prevent the sending of confidential information.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl17_desc_conf">The service that is responsible for collecting and transmitting data about the system and its use, or a function that is not related to the operation of the video driver, is useless. Why and what kind of information NVIDIA collects is known only to itself. But the fact that this does not bring anything useful to the end user is quite obvious.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl18_desc_conf">The tweak disables the UAR (User Activity Recording) feature – a system that sequentially logs every action you take on your computer: from taking screenshots and typing text to launching programs and even providing access to the webcam while the screen is locked, and much more.</v:String>

    <v:String x:Key="tgl18_desc_intf">Windows 11 sometimes shows hints on how to use a particular feature, for example, the new «Start» menu or «Quick Settings». They are useful if you are seeing Windows 11 for the first time, as it is useless junk.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl19_desc_intf">By default, Windows adds padding between items in Explorer. This is a new feature designed for touch screens. This tweak will restore the classic layout of the file explorer, removing the indentation between the elements and saving you from searching for settings.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl20_desc_intf">The tweak disables and, where possible, hides Copilot icons on the taskbar, in the «Start Menu», in Edge, and in Notepad, blocking its functionality, and also disables Recall. At the same time, the core Copilot application itself is not affected, remains in the system, and can be used if needed. Copilot can only be fully removed along with Microsoft Edge. If these AI features are not present in your Windows initially, using the tweak is pointless.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl21_desc_intf">This tweak will allow you to add the «End task» option to the context menu when you right-click on the application on the taskbar. This speeds up the completion of processes without having to open the task Manager. Attention the screen may blink.</v:String>

    <v:String x:Key="tgl24_desc_intf">By default, Windows uses the collected information to target ads, i.e. to display ads that match your interests. And literally, this advertisement is located wherever free space is available for display. If you don't want Windows to display personalized ads in all Store apps, Explorer, Options, and the Start menu, then you can disable this junk.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl25_desc_intf">By default, Windows does not save the positions of windows, as well as their state when turned off. This tweak will allow you to remember the type of open folders in order to restore them after Logging out, Rebooting and Shutting down.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl26_desc_intf">Tweak allows disabling all Windows tips and notifications, including online hints in settings, as well as disabling Second Chance Out of Box Experience (SCOOBE) for Windows 11 users.

If you don't need Bing integration in the «Start» menu, you can apply a tweak to disable web search. Attention the screen may blink.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl32_desc_intf">By default, when you open Explorer, the first tab will be «Quick Access». And to open any disk, you need to make unnecessary movements. This tweak will make «This PC» open when opened, rather than «Quick Access».</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl33_desc_intf">By default, Windows hides file extensions, which makes the File Explorer view less cluttered. If needed, you can enable the display of file extensions using this tweak, saving you the time spent searching. Attention the screen may blink.</v:String>

    <v:String x:Key="tgl12_desc_sys">This tweak disables the automatic launch of Windows memory diagnostics by turning off the scheduled task. As a result, the system boots faster due to the absence of unnecessary checks, while you retain the option to run diagnostics manually when needed.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl13_desc_sys">This tweak disables the Teredo, ISATAP, and IPv6 protocols, which, as a rule, are not required by the majority of users. However, it is not advisable to apply it on work or corporate devices: this may lead to network problems or improper functioning of some services.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl14_desc_sys">This tweak includes support for a large file system cache. Increasing the size of the file system cache generally improves computer performance, but this in turn reduces the physical memory space available for applications and services.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl15_desc_sys">By default, Windows has a built-in mechanism to slow down startup programs. This solution works quite well on older computers with HDD, but on modern PCs with SSD unnecessarily slows down the system startup with programs.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl16_desc_sys">The tweak will disable the recording of the usage history of files and folders displayed on the Quick Access panel. In other words, the system will no longer automatically save and show the most recent active items.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl17_desc_sys">The tweak disables autorun for various removable media types connected to your computer that Explorer is trying to open. Thus, a program unknown to you will not open automatically on a medium that you are not sure of its reliability.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl18_desc_sys">Adds the «Ultimate Performance» power supply circuit, or if available, simply switches to the existing power supply circuit. In addition, it unlocks the setting of the maximum processor frequency in the processor power management settings.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl19_desc_sys">If you don't need Bluetooth and you don't want to use your devices via Bluetooth, then turn it off, and it will also remove the tray icon.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl20_desc_sys">The firewall allows you to regulate the access of programs to the Internet by permitting or blocking their connections and controlling the traffic.

    <v:String x:Key="tgl21_desc_sys">The game mode does not have much effect on powerful systems. However, if you have a lot of processes running in the background, then the mode ensures that background processes will not affect the operation of the game.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl22_desc_sys">A function for recording your games. By and large, it uses up the resources of your system. There are many better alternatives, and in addition, which do not open spontaneously.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl23_desc_sys">Some applications allow you to manage background activity, which determines what they can do when they are in the background and not actively used. In general, disabling background applications will help reduce network load, as well as CPU load and power consumption, which is useful for laptops because it prolongs battery life.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl24_desc_sys">Reserved storage is designed to provide a predictable allocation of free space that will be used by updates, applications, temporary files, and the system cache. Disabling it can free up a significant amount of space. However, if you have enough free space, it is not recommended to do this, you will not receive any additional benefits.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl25_desc_sys">Disabling the dynamic timer and HPET can improve system responsiveness by reducing micro‑stutter and yield a slight performance boost. However, the effect depends on the configuration: in some cases, instead of speeding up, the system may slow down and experience lag. If you're using a laptop, note that this may also slightly increase power consumption, as the CPU will remain more active even when idle.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl26_desc_sys">Tweak blocks intrusive automatic installation of PC Health Check - Microsoft utility that forcibly deploys itself through Windows Update without permission. Once installed, program constantly nags about «checking Windows 11 readiness» and pushes unsolicited «optimization recommendations».</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl27_desc_sys">For Windows Insider participants, these tasks should remain enabled. However, if you are not part of the program, all associated tasks become unnecessary overhead: they consume system resources, generate useless logs, and may initiate telemetry connections without providing any benefit. Disabling them can improve startup time and overall system performance while also eliminating unneeded experimental data collection channels.</v:String>
    <v:String x:Key="tgl28_desc_sys">If you have an SSD, disabling defragmentation and boot file optimization, which are effective only for hard drives (HDD), helps extend the lifespan of your drive. At the same time, the TRIM optimization function continues to work: it informs the SSD controller which data blocks are no longer in use and clears them, maintaining stable speed and drive longevity.</v:String>
